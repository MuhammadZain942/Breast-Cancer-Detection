Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning
This project is a machine learning application to predict breast cancer as either malignant or benign based on clinical features. The dataset used is sourced from Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset.

Features
Preprocessing of clinical data (e.g., handling missing values, scaling, and encoding categorical variables).
Training and evaluation of multiple machine learning models:
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Performance metrics include accuracy and cross-validation scores.
Generation of classification reports for deeper insights into model performance.
Requirements
Libraries
The project uses the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
sklearn
matplotlib (optional, for visualizations)
Install the dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The dataset contains 30 features related to tumor characteristics, including:

Mean, standard error, and worst values of radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, symmetry, etc.
A target column (diagnosis) indicating whether the cancer is Malignant (M) or Benign (B).
Data Preprocessing
Dropped irrelevant and missing columns (id, Unnamed: 32).
Encoded the target variable: M → 1, B → 0.
Normalized features using Min-Max Scaling.
Project Workflow
Data Splitting:

Train/Test split (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).
Model Training:

Random Forest: A tree-based ensemble classifier.
SVM: A kernel-based classification algorithm.
Evaluation:

Metrics: Accuracy, mean cross-validation accuracy, and standard deviation.
Classification report with precision, recall, and F1 scores.
Result Storage:

Results for each model stored in a dictionary for further analysis.
Results
Sample output for the models:

Random Forest:

Accuracy: 96%
Cross-validation mean accuracy: 0.9543 (+/- 0.0435)

SVM:

Accuracy: 97%
Cross-validation mean accuracy: 0.9737 (+/- 0.0221)
